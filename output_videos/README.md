# Output Results

This folder contains annotated videos and detection summaries generated by the Football Analysis System after fine-tuning the YOLOv11l model. Youâ€™ll find:

- **Annotated Videos** (*.mp4): Match footage with bounding boxes for players, referees, and especially the ball.  
- **Detection Logs** (*.csv): Frame-by-frame confidence scores and track IDs.  
- **Snapshots** (*.png): Example frames highlighting improved ball detection.  

> **Note:** After fine-tuning on Roboflow data, I observed a **huge improvement** in both player localization and **ball detection accuracy**, especially in fast-paced sequences.

## How to Use

1. Place your raw videos in `input_videos/` and run:  
       
       python main.py

2. Processed outputs will appear here in `output_videos/` and logs in `output_logs/`.
