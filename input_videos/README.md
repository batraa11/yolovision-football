# Input Videos

This folder contains raw football match footage to be processed by the Football Analysis System. Supported formats include `.mp4`, `.avi`, and `.mov`.

## Instructions

1. Place your unprocessed match videos into this folder.
2. Run the analysis system:
   
       python main.py

3. Select the desired video file from this directory when prompted.

## Notes

- Ensure videos are of sufficient resolution (720p or higher recommended) for optimal detection accuracy.
- Shorter clips (1â€“3 minutes) are ideal for testing model performance and speed.
- Output files will be saved to the `output_videos/` and `output_logs/` folders.
